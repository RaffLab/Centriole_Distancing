# Centriole_Distancing


## Getting Started

These instructions will provide you with a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It was developed in Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon using an Anaconda Python 2.7 distribution.

### Installation


### Example Usage
The easiest way to use the library of functions is to see provided example pipelines under 'Examples/' folder. The recommended way is to use config files to set the experimental parameters. Inside 'Examples' there are three scripts:

Script Name | Function
------------| -------------
`run_centriole_detection.py` | Content from cell 2
`run_centriole_distancing.py` | Content in the second column
`export_distancing_statistics.py` | Content in the second column
